# Interpretable Machine Learning: Exercise 3

## Instructions

1. Install the open-source-distribution [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. Create a new environment with python 3.9 and activate it. If you already created an environment for a previous exercise, feel free to reuse it.
```
conda create -n iML python=3.9
conda activate iML
```

3. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Add your code in all `tasks/*.py` files according to the exercise sheet. You can run them with `python tasks/*.py`. All functions are called automatically.
5. Test all tasks with `pytest` or specific files with `pytest tests/test_*.py`.
6. Push your solution to your repository.

Code is tested on Linux and Mac only. Testing is not guaranteed to work on Windows or VMs.
